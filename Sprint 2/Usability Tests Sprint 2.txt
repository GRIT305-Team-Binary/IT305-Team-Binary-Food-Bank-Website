Sponser.php

Why are they not colored gold silver and bronze
What if I want to donate $100 a month
What if I want to donate less than $80 a month and I don't care about the reward levels.

Verbal recogniztion. They are going to read out everyone who donates more than $85 a month, that sounds boring. 

Why is it First Name Last Name then Middle Initial
Shouldn't it be First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name or Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial

Which of the fields are required. I don't see any asterisk. 

What if I don't have a logo
Are these Corporate Sponsers?

WOuld like a label indicating what the form is.

What is Don't E. Donte As in the Inferno, even that has an A?

What are the raffle tickets for?

When is the Kent Food Bank Annual Breakfast?

Sponsor Form Test:

Usability tester was confused by order of inputs. 
Can we change to First Name, Middle Initial, and Last Name

When you submit a blank form it takes you to the top of the screen where there is a Thank you Message:
Your generosity is greatly appreciated! THANK YOU!!!
Makes user think that it has been submitted

Donte at a Gold Level, Silver Level, Bronze Level
Needs changed to Donate

What is a valid First Name?
I tried P, Peter, FirstName, and First Name and I continue to get an error. 
When I inspect I see this: 
<input type="text" name="fName" value="P" style="cursor: pointer; background-image: url(&quot;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAABHklEQVQ4EaVTO26DQBD1ohQWaS2lg9JybZ+AK7hNwx2oIoVf4UPQ0Lj1FdKktevIpel8AKNUkDcWMxpgSaIEaTVv3sx7uztiTdu2s/98DywOw3Dued4Who/M2aIx5lZV1aEsy0+qiwHELyi+Ytl0PQ69SxAxkWIA4RMRTdNsKE59juMcuZd6xIAFeZ6fGCdJ8kY4y7KAuTRNGd7jyEBXsdOPE3a0QGPsniOnnYMO67LgSQN9T41F2QGrQRRFCwyzoIF2qyBuKKbcOgPXdVeY9rMWgNsjf9ccYesJhk3f5dYT1HX9gR0LLQR30TnjkUEcx2uIuS4RnI+aj6sJR0AM8AaumPaM/rRehyWhXqbFAA9kh3/8/NvHxAYGAsZ/il8IalkCLBfNVAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&quot;); background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 98% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat;">
