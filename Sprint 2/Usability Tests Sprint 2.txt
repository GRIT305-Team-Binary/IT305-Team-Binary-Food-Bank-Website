Sponser

Why are they not colored gold silver and bronze
What if I want to donate $100 a month
What if I want to donate less than $80 a month and I don't care about the reward levels.

Verbal recogniztion. They are going to read out everyone who donates more than $85 a month, that sounds boring. 

Why is it First Name Last Name then Middle Initial
Shouldn't it be First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name or Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial

Which of the fields are required. I don't see any asterisk. 

What if I don't have a logo
Are these Corporate Sponsers?
